Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial wanted the most up to date software security for their RESTful web application.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
Coding securely helps to keep important data safe from attackers and people who wish to misuse it. Having good software security at a company lends them important credibility. No one wants to use the services of a company who can't guarantee the safety of their information. I ran a dependency check on their application and was able to pinpoint exactly which areas of their program were causing security vulnerabilities.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
To increase layers of security I used a top-down approach, starting with input validation and working through cryptography, client/server vulnerabilities, fixing code errors, ensuring code quality, and running a dependency check. In the future I would assess the software to see which of the previously mentioned layers needed to be addressed and run multiple dependency checks.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Testing the code in debug mode is extremely important in ensuring that you haven't introduced new vulnerabilities as well as running dependency checks when necessary.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Once again, the dependency checks proved to be invaluable, so I will be making frequent use of those on future projects.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I did a good job interpreting the client's needs and assessing areas of risk within the software.
